## System.out in Java

`System.out` is the first instance of the *OutputStream* class most programmers encounter. In fact, it's often encountered before programmers know what a class or an output stream is. 
Specifically, `System.out` is the static out field of the `java.lang.System` class. It's an 
instance of `java.io.PrintStream`, a subclass of `java.io.OutputStream`. 
`System.out` corresponds to `stdout` in Unix or C. Normally, output sent to `System.out`
appears on the console. As a general rule, the console converts the numeric byte data `System.out` sends to it into **ASCII** or **ISO** **Latin-1** text. Thus, the following lines write the string "Hello World!" on the console: 
```
byte[] hello = {72, 101, 108, 108, 111, 32, 87, 111, 114, 108, 100, 33, 10, 
 13}; 
System.out.write(hello);
```
